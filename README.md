Data storytelling isn’t just about numbers — it’s about clarity, impact, and design.
Here’s how I transformed a simple metric into a powerful KPI card in Power BI using the Card with States visual:
🔹 Step 1: Import the Card with States visual from the marketplace.
🔹 Step 2: Bind your KPI measure (e.g., Total Profit).
🔹 Step 3: Get more Visual ---> Start by selecting the Card visual, and follow the step-by-step process shown in the images.
🔹 Step 4: Add a trend line to show the monthly performance of profit over time.
🔹 Step 5: Customize fonts, colors, and layout to match your theme.
